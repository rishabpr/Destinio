                    students and college freshman a broad outline of
                    engineering and help them decide on a career in engineering. The course explores the different
                    disciplines of engineering and providing participants with a broad background in different areas of
                    engineering.</p>

                <p >Do you want to learn how race-cars are built? How
                    robots are able to work independently? How is
                    energy harvested? How is energy stored? How are organs built? How is the body imaged? How do you
                    design an aircraft? How do electrons travel in micro and nanoelectronics? How are drugs delivered in
                    the body? How do you build on soils that are unstable? How do robots see? How is light used in
                    devices? How is data stored and managed? How is pollution mitigated? How are electrical signals
                    processed? How are strong and tough materials designed and built? How is thermal energy managed?
                    How is data transmitted? How are systems integrated? How do you make sure goods and services
                    reach their destination? These are all things that engineers are dealing with on a daily basis and
                    will
                    form the basis of the first part of the course.
