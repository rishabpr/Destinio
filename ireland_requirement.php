                <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2><br>

                <p>Citizens of certain countries must apply for an entry visa before they
                    travel to Ireland. Information on those who need an entry visa is can be obtained by consulting with
                    our experienced staff. </p>

                <p>If you require a visit/holiday visa and do not have one when you arrive in
                    Ireland, you will not be allowed to enter the country. A visit/holiday visa is
                    for a short-term stay and will not exceed a maximum of 90 days.</p>

                <p>If you are a citizen of an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland, you donot require a visit/holiday visa
                    to travel to Ireland. You have the
                    right to enter and reside in Ireland for a period of up to 3 months simply by
                    presenting a valid passport or national identity card; no other formality is
                    required. There is no additional conditions concerning the minimum validity of
                    duration of the identity card or passport. The members of the EEA are the 28
                    countries of the European Union (EU), together with Iceland, Norway and
                    Liechtenstein). There is information
                    for non-EEA nationals applying for a short-stay visa to accompany or join an EU
                    citizen family member in Ireland on the <b>Irish Naturalisation &amp;
                        Immigration Service (INIS)</b> website.</p>

                <p>Even if you do not require a visa to enter Ireland, all non-EEA nationals
                    must obtain permission
                    to enter the State by reporting to an Immigration Officer at the port of
                    entry. You should have supporting documentation relating to the purpose of your
                    visit (see below).</p>

                <p>The Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme allows nationals of a number of Eastern
                    European, Middle East and Asian countries who have a short-term UK visa to come
                    to Ireland without the need for a separate Irish visa. This programme has been
                    extended to 31 October 2021.</p>

                <p><b>The British Irish Visa Scheme</b> applies to visitors from China since 20 October 2014 and
                    to visitors from India since 9 February 2015. This scheme allows visitors from
                    these countries to travel freely within the Common Travel Area (in this case,
                    Ireland and the UK but not the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man), using
                    either an Irish or UK visa.</p>

                <h3><b>Documentation required for all visa applications</b></h3>
                <br>
                <p>The following information describes the minimum documentation that you
                    must provide with any visa application. If any of this
                    documentation is missing your application will be refused.</p>

                <p>All documents must be in English. If any document is in another language, you must provide a
                    notarised translationas well as the original document.</p>
